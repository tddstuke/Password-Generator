# Password-Generator

This is a password generator I created using JavaScript.

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked you will be:
* prompted for a length of password between 8 and 128 characters
* Prompted to include lowercase characters Yes or No
* Prompted to include uppercase characters Yes or NO
* Prompted to include numbers Yes or NO
* Prompted to include special charactes Yes or No
* If answered No to all prompts you will be asked to pick at least one
* When all prompts are answered a password will be generated using the criteria provided
